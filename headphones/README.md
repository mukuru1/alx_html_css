Mobile Responsiveness:

The web page will automatically switch to a mobile-optimized layout when the screen width is 480px or smaller.
Ensure the mobile version is optimized for touchscreens and provides a seamless user experience on smaller devices.
Link and Button Styles:

Hover/Active State: Links and buttons will have a distinct hover and active state to provide visual feedback to the user.
Links: Hover/active color: #FF6565
Buttons: Hover/active opacity: 0.9
Content Layout:

The main content area will have a maximum width of 1000px.
This content will be centered horizontally within the page, ensuring a balanced layout on various screen sizes.
Additional Considerations:

Image Optimization: Compress images to reduce file size and improve loading times, especially on mobile devices.
Accessibility: Adhere to web accessibility guidelines (WCAG) to ensure the design is usable by people with disabilities.
Cross-Browser Compatibility: Test the design in major web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to ensure consistent rendering and functionality.
