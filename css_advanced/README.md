Welcome to the Smile School Website!

This is the code for a website about learning how to smile. It includes features like:

A header with a logo, navigation bar, and call to action button
A main section with information about the benefits of smiling, instructors, popular tutorials, and membership options
A footer with the company logo, social media links, and copyright information
Dependencies:

This code relies on external resources like images (logo.png, 1.png, etc.) and Font Awesome icons (from kit.fontawesome.com) to function properly. Make sure you have these files in the same directory as the HTML file.
The styles for the website are likely defined in a separate CSS file (styles.css) linked in the <head> section. You'll also need this file for the website to display correctly.
How to Use This Code:

Download the HTML file, any image files referenced in the code (logo.png, etc.), and the styles.css file (if it exists) into the same directory.
Open the HTML file in a web browser to see the website.
Additional Notes:

The content within the <h3> and <p> tags throughout the code provides placeholder text. You'll want to replace this with your own content specific to your smiling school.
You can further customize the website by editing the HTML and CSS files.
